# Composite_Material_Dataset_Data_Analytics
The uploaded dataset appears to be related to various composite materials, and it includes the following columns:

Material Composition: Describes the composition of the material, such as "Polymer Matrix" or "Carbon Nanotubes."
Fabrication Technique: Specifies the method used to fabricate the composite, like "Langmuir-Blodgett" or "Electrospinning."
Tensile Strength (MPa): The tensile strength of the material in Mega Pascals (MPa).
Thermal Conductivity (W/m·K): The thermal conductivity of the material in Watts per meter-Kelvin.
Elastic Modulus (GPa): The elastic modulus of the material in Giga Pascals (GPa).
Density (g/cm³): The density of the material in grams per cubic centimeter.
Fiber Volume Fraction (%): The volume fraction of fibers in the composite, represented as a percentage.
